A high-performance, asynchronous web service built with **Raku** and the **Cro** framework for receiving and processing foreign signals.

## About The Project

**obcygnalk** is a robust backend service designed as a reliable endpoint for incoming data streams, webhooks, or any form of "foreign signal." It leverages the power of Raku's concurrency and the modern, feature-rich Cro toolkit to provide a scalable and maintainable solution.

This project is developed as part of the **Raku Community** initiative, aiming to provide a solid template for building microservices. The core architecture is the **IDEMK Cro Server**, a pattern for creating dependable Raku-based web applications.

### Key Features

*   **Asynchronous by Design:** Built on Cro, it handles many concurrent connections with ease.
*   **Modern Raku:** Uses modern Raku features for expressive and safe code.
*   **Test-Driven:** A complete test suite in the `t/` directory to ensure reliability.
*   **Extensible:** Easily add new routes, middleware, and logic in the `lib/` directory.
*   **Simple to Deploy:** Standard Raku application structure, ready for containerization.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to follow Raku community best practices.

```
./obcygnalk
├── Bin/
│   └── app.raku         # Main executable to start the server
├── Image/
│   └── logo.png         # Project images and assets
├── Home/
│   └── ...              # Resources for a potential front-end or landing page

*   **`Bin/`**: Contains the main executable script to launch the Cro service.
*   **`Image/`**: Static image assets for documentation or a potential web frontend.
*   **`Home/`**: A directory intended for user-facing assets, like HTML/CSS/JS for a status page.
*   **`Lib/`**: The heart of the application. All Raku modules (`.rakumod`) defining the application's logic, routes, and data structures live here.
*   **`t/`**: The test suite. All tests end in `.t` and are run with `prove`.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

You need to have a Raku compiler and the `zef` module installer.
*   **Rakudo**: [https://rakudo.org/downloads](https://rakudo.org/downloads)
*   **Zef**: Usually included with Rakudo distributions.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/obcygnalk.git
    cd obcygnalk
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This command reads the `META6.json` file and installs all required modules, including Cro.
    ```sh
    zef --deps-only install .
    ```

### Running the Server

To start the **obcygnalk** service, run the executable script from the `Bin` directory. The `-Ilib` flag tells Raku to look for modules in our `Lib` directory.

```sh
raku -Ilib Bin/app.raku
```

You should see output from Cro indicating the server has started, typically on a local port.
```
===SORRY!===
[CRI] Cro::HTTP::Server listening on http://0.0.0.0:10000
```

You can now send requests to `http://localhost:10000`.

### Running Tests

To ensure everything is working as expected, you can run the test suite:

```sh
prove -e raku -r t/
```
